This Android project uses ClipsAndroid as a library to perform some basic operations:
 * Log the version of CLIPS.
 * Print a [helloworld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program) message.
 * Show the result of an aritmetic operation.
 * Load a CLP file with information about people.
 * Insert a new person.
 * Update information from another person.
 * Show all the people.

The people example was taken from a [document made by C. Daniel Sánchez Ramírez](https://bitbucket.org/ErunamoJAZZ/trash-it/src/94282935833e4271065787ba75d02a7ce6ff9b24/docs/Como%20Utilizar%20CPLISJNI.pdf?at=default).
Actually, this document was very useful to understand how CLIPSJNI and CLIPS work, so I thank him twice.
